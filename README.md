#### RFC 8785: Canonical Pale Ale

The beer that *never changes*.
Same hops, same order, same bytes - every. freakin. time.
If you taste a difference, you're the one out of spec.

#### RFC 3339: Temporal IPA

For those who live in UTC and die in milliseconds.

A bright, assertive IPA brewed with the precision of a timestamp and the bitterness of missed deadlines. Hops burst forward like a T between date and time, while citrus notes tick in at predictable intervals. No ambiguity. No daylight saving. Just a crisp, well-structured brew that always ends with a Z.

Best enjoyed while parsing ISO 8601 strings, debugging time zone drift, or realizing your scheduled job ran yesterday.

ABV: 6.0%
Format: RFC3339-compliant
WARNING: May cause irreversible awareness of how broken datetime handling truly is.
